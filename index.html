      <h1>Introduction</h1>
      <p>I'm a student at the UW coding bootcamp working toward a career in development.</p>
      <h1>Where I'm From</h1>
      <p>I was born and raised in Big Bear Lake, CA. After hight school, I moved to Pittsburgh, PA. after the better half of four years in Pennsylvania, I found myself moving between California again, Utah, and finally, Seattle, Washington.</p>
      <h1>What are your favorite hobbies?</h1>
      <p>I'm a digital artist, musician, and a cook. I greatly enjoy unwinding in video games with friends online and the occasional party to cut loose.</p>
      <h1>What's your dream job?</h1>
      <p>I'm passionate about computer hardware and video games. I find GPUs to be fascinating, and the expanding use cases for GPUs excites and intrigues me. I'm also a big fan of VR and look forward to the developments there as well. I'd love to be able to contribute to the evolution of these technologies whether it be in creating digital environments, or creating the arcitecture that makes them possible. </p>
      <h1>Where do you live?</h1>
      <p>I currently reside in Renton, WA.</p>
      <h1>Why do you want to be a web developer?</h1>
      <p>I've been using computers or art, games, and occasionally work for most of my life. I figure it's time to expand what skills I already have and apply them in a way that can help me carve a path for a career in the field.</p>
